// Label logging for the learned pruning guide.
//
// Driver searches (self-play games, or the positions in a file) run with
// label sampling on. A node with d plies left (not the root, not in check,
// d <= max_label_depth) is picked with probability 1 / rate(d), where
// rate(d) = sample_rate / (depth_scale / 100)^(d - 1): deeper nodes are
// much rarer in the tree, so they are sampled more often to balance the
// depths. Each picked node is recorded with its search context, then
// searched on its own to depth d by a separate searcher whose hash table
// and history are cleared first, so that a label depends only on its
// position and depth. One CSV row per node:
//
//   fen, depth, ply, static_eval, correction, search_eval, alpha, beta,
//   improving, node, under_null, iir, score, mate, <guide_features::NAMES...>,
//   group, rate, tt_hit, tt_depth, tt_bound, tree_nodes, reached_moves,
//   fresh_nodes, censored, fresh_curve, score_curve
//
// All scores are from the side to move's view. static_eval is the node's
// static eval, correction history included; correction is how much of it
// came from correction history, a rough measure of how unreliable the raw
// eval has been in this pawn structure. search_eval is the eval pruning
// decided with: static_eval, or the hash score where its bound made it a
// sharper estimate. alpha and beta are the node's window in the driver's
// tree (so search_eval - beta is what reverse futility and null-move
// pruning compare with their margins); node is pv, cut or all; under_null is 1
// if the node lies below a null move. depth is the depth node-level pruning
// saw; iir is 1 if the node's moves were then searched a ply shallower
// (internal iterative reduction). score is the depth-d search result,
// clipped to +-LABEL_SCORE_CLIP, with mate = 1 when it was a mate score.
//
// The columns after the features serve the cost head (Try 4's e head).
// group numbers the self-play game or input line a row came from: its rows
// are correlated, so split training and
// validation by group, never by row. rate is the row's 1-in-N sampling
// rate, to weight rows back to how common their depth is in a real tree.
// Two costs, answering different questions:
//
//   tree_nodes: what the node cost where it stood in the driver's tree
//     (its window, a warm hash table and histories): every node of its
//     subtree, node-level pruning and verification searches included.
//     tt_hit, tt_depth and tt_bound (none, upper, lower, exact) are the hash
//     entry it found, which explains much of it; reached_moves is 0 when
//     node-level pruning ended it before the move loop.
//   fresh_nodes: what depth `depth` costs from a cold start and a full
//     window: the labelling search's total. fresh_curve has its nodes by
//     the end of each iteration 1..depth and score_curve each iteration's
//     score (';'-separated), so one label gives the cost and the score of
//     every shallower depth too.
//
// With a node cap (label_node_cap), a labelling search that reaches it
// stops early: censored is 1, the curves hold the iterations it finished,
// score is the last finished iteration's rather than depth `depth`'s, and
// fresh_nodes is only a lower bound.
//
// The labelling search prunes with the current margins, so labels depend
// on them: each round of retuned margins calls for regenerated data. The
// parameters in force are written next to the CSV, in <out>.params.
