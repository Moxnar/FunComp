// Backrank Bingo: shuffled-piece starting positions close to normal chess,
// for data generation and as a second opening book. Pawns, king and rooks
// stand on their usual squares; each side's queen, bishops and knights are
// shuffled over the b, c, d, f and g files of its back rank, with the
// bishops on opposite colours. 18 arrangements a side (the standard one
// among them), chosen independently for White and Black: 324 starts.
// Castling is ordinary, so any engine and GUI plays them.

// The 324 starting positions as FENs, White to move, in a fixed order.
