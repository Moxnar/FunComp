.SYNOPSIS
Plays an SPRT match between two engines with fastchess.

.DESCRIPTION
Stops as soon as the sequential probability ratio test decides between
H0 (the new engine is Elo0 or worse than the base) and H1 (it is Elo1 or
better), with 5% error rates both ways. Elo is normalized Elo, as on
OpenBench and fishtest.

Use -Elo0 0 -Elo1 5 for a change meant to gain strength, and
-Elo0 -5 -Elo1 0 for one that only has to do no harm (a simplification,
a speedup that changes the bench, a refactor).

Engine options go in as Name=Value strings. Every parameter in params.h
can be set this way, so one build can be played against itself with a
heuristic switched off or a margin changed. fastchess only sends options
the engine advertises (it skips the rest with a warning), so such runs
need a build configured with -DTUNE=ON. The script checks this and
refuses to start otherwise.

.EXAMPLE
# Is the new build better than the pre-pruning engine?
tools\sprt.ps1 -New build\chess.exe -Base engines\v0.1-nopruning.exe -Book books\UHO_Lichess_4852_v1.epd

.EXAMPLE
# Does razoring earn its keep? The base is the same build with it off.
tools\sprt.ps1 -New build\chess.exe -Base build\chess.exe -BaseOptions 'RazorMaxDepth=0' -Book books\UHO_Lichess_4852_v1.epd

.EXAMPLE
# A larger futility margin, as a non-regression test.
tools\sprt.ps1 -New build\chess.exe -Base build\chess.exe -NewOptions 'FpBase=150' -Elo0 -5 -Elo1 0 -Book books\UHO_Lichess_4852_v1.epd
